<p>I am a Web Developer for Edinburgh Software Limited. I graduated from <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/">Heriot-Watt University</a> with a BSc in Computer Science in 2018. I’m interested in the web, functional programming and making things.</p>
<p>My favourite languages are <a href="https://www.smlnj.org/">SML-NJ</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a>, Javascript (ES6) and SQL. Java, Python and PHP are some more languages that I am proficient in.</p>
<p>It serves no real purpose, and is not very well maintained

<h2 id="coffee">Coffee</h2>
<p>I’m very much into coffee, some might say that it’s my “thing”. I competed in the Scottish Aeropress Championships 2017, worked in a coffee shop for a while, and have purchased over 6kg of whole coffee beans since April 2017 (when I started counting). My preferred brewing method is in a v60, but I also have 2 <a href="http://www.aeropress.co.uk/">Aeropresses</a>, a classic Bialetti, a few french presses, 2 automatic drip machines, a Gaggia Classic espresso machine, a beta MBK <a href="http://www.madebyknock.com/store/p39/aergrind_.html">aergrind</a> and a baratza encore burr grinder. The coffee shops that are certainly worth your time can be found on my map <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UEdtWQxKDI8KigkPtonOyYFFjkI&amp;usp=sharing">here</a> (the golden ones are my top 3).</p>
